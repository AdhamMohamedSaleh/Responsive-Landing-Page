## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- Flexbox  
- CSS Grid  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Mobile-first workflow  
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) – React framework  

### What I learned
- Improved accessibility by using `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>` landmarks.  
- Learned that combining Flexbox and Grid creates cleaner, more flexible layouts.  
- Used `col-reverse` for mobile-first responsive design.  
- Practiced optimizing background images with Next.js `Image` component.  

### Continued development
- Focus more on accessibility for screen readers.  
- Implement better carousel/slider logic without external libraries.  
- Improve deployment workflows with Vercel.  

### Useful resources
- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) – for quick responsive design setup.  
- [Next.js Image Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image) – helped with image optimization.  
- [The A11y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/) – for accessibility best practices.
